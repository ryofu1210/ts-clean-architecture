# TypeScript Implementation of Clean Architecture
Welcome to the repository where we reimplement the Clean Architecture pattern, originally designed in C# by nrslib, using TypeScript.

## Overview
This project is a TypeScript adaptation of the Clean Architecture principles as demonstrated in the [nrslib/CleanArchitecture](https://github.com/nrslib/CleanArchitecture) repository. It is designed to provide a structured, scalable, and maintainable codebase, following the best practices of TypeScript and the core concepts of Clean Architecture.
